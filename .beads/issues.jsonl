{"id":"multi_agent_beads-k5ul","title":"Epic: Portable Multi-Town Agent Orchestration System","description":"## Vision\nTransform the multi-agent system into a portable, daemon-based orchestration platform that can:\n1. Run from any folder (like beads does)\n2. Support multiple concurrent \"towns\" of workers on different ports\n3. Provide a Web UI admin page for all management (no CLI required for spawning)\n4. Work in conjunction with the beads daemon pattern\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n### 1. Portable Installation\n- Install as a global CLI tool (like `bd` itself)\n- Run `mab init` in any repo to enable agent orchestration\n- No project-specific installation required\n\n### 2. Daemon Architecture  \n- Background daemon process for worker lifecycle management\n- RPC communication (like beads uses)\n- Health monitoring and auto-restart\n- Clean shutdown handling\n\n### 3. Web Admin UI\n- Start/stop workers with a click\n- Choose port per town instance\n- View all active towns and their workers\n- Real-time logs and status per worker\n- Role-based worker spawning (Developer, QA, Tech Lead, etc.)\n\n### 4. Multi-Town Support\n- Run multiple independent orchestrations\n- Each town on its own port\n- Isolated worker pools per town\n- Cross-town visibility in a master dashboard (optional)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Can run `mab` from any folder after global install\n- [ ] Single daemon manages worker lifecycle\n- [ ] Web UI replaces CLI for all worker operations\n- [ ] Can run 3+ towns simultaneously on different ports\n- [ ] Works seamlessly with existing beads integration","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T16:08:31.798517-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-01-26T18:14:38.167452-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T18:14:38.167452-07:00","close_reason":"All success criteria met: (1) CLI tool with global entry point, (2) Daemon with RPC/health checks, (3) Web Admin UI with spawn/stop/monitor, (4) Multi-town support with SQLite persistence, (5) Beads integration via dashboard routes.
