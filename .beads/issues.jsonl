{"id":"multi_agent_beads-0v2do","title":"[Bug] Workers crash before claiming beads - no work executed","description":"## Problem\nWorkers spawned via dashboard crash repeatedly before they can claim any beads.\n\n## Evidence\n- Worker `worker-dev-0f96fb4f` spawned via dashboard\n- Worker showed RUNNING status initially (PID 65240)\n- Worker crashed and auto-restarted 4 times in ~6 minutes\n- No `claude.log` created in worker worktree\n- Test bead `multi_agent_beads-3fyc4` was never claimed\n\n## Timeline\n1. Spawned worker via dashboard - status RUNNING\n2. After 30 seconds - still RUNNING (TC4 pass)\n3. After 60 seconds - status changed to CRASHED\n4. Auto-restart kicked in - new PID assigned\n5. Crash/restart cycle repeated 4 times\n6. After 2+ minutes - bead still unclaimed\n\n## What Works (PR #29 fix verified)\n- Workers get assigned PIDs (not immediately defunct)\n- Workers show RUNNING status briefly\n- Auto-restart feature works correctly\n- This proves the --print to -p flag fix is working\n\n## Root Cause Theory\nWorkers start successfully but crash before entering the work loop. Possible causes:\n1. Worker prompt file missing or malformed\n2. Environment variable issue\n3. Claude CLI error during initialization\n4. Permission or path issue in worktree\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start dashboard: `mab dashboard`\n2. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin\n3. Start daemon (click Start button)\n4. Spawn Developer worker\n5. Observe worker crashes repeatedly\n\n## Investigation Needed\n1. Check worker stderr (not just claude.log)\n2. Run claude CLI manually with worker prompt\n3. Check for missing configuration\n4. Review spawner.py process lifecycle\n\n## Related\n- Discovered during: multi_agent_beads-hti5l (QA verification)\n- Test bead: multi_agent_beads-3fyc4 (close as artifact)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T11:30:02.730718-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-01-31T11:49:35.323094-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T11:49:35.323094-06:00","close_reason":"PR #31 merged, CI passed - symlinked .beads directory in worktrees to fix stale database issue","labels":["dev"]}

Tech Lead role option fails - says invalid agent\n\n## Evidence\n- User spawns Developer → shows 'unknown' \n- User tries Tech Lead → error 'invalid agent'\n\n## Likely Causes\n1. Role not being passed correctly from form to API\n2. Role mapping mismatch between frontend dropdown values and backend expected values\n3. Tech Lead may be 'tech_lead' in backend but 'Tech Lead' in dropdown\n\n## Debug Steps\n1. Check admin.html dropdown values vs API expected values\n2. Check spawn_worker endpoint role parameter handling\n3. Check spawner.py ROLE_TO_PROMPT mapping\n\n## Frontend dropdown values (admin.html):\n- Developer, QA, Reviewer, Tech Lead, Manager\n\n## Backend expected (spawner.py):\n- dev, qa, reviewer, tech_lead, manager\n\n## Fix Required\n- Map frontend display names to backend role codes\n- Or update dropdown values to match backend expectations\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All roles spawn correctly\n- Spawned workers show correct role name\n- Tech Lead works","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T16:08:57.09999-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-01-29T16:21:17.424463-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T16:21:17.424463-06:00","close_reason":"PR #1 merged: Fixed Tech Lead role mapping from tech-lead to tech_lead in admin dropdowns","labels":["api","bug","dashboard"]}

Title/Description Field Isolation Test\n\n**Initial Result:** FAILED with Chrome MCP sequential `fill` operations\n\n**Root Cause Investigation:**\n- Used JavaScript `evaluate_script` to test direct field assignment - PASSED\n- Used Chrome MCP `fill_form` (batch fill) - PASSED\n- Only Chrome MCP sequential `fill` operations cause the bug\n\n**Conclusion:** The dashboard form code is CORRECT. The \"bug\" is actually in Chrome MCP's sequential fill implementation, not in the dashboard. The original bug fix in multi_agent_beads-os5ld was likely addressing a real issue that has been fixed.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Fields are separate DOM elements (confirmed via JS: `areSameElement: false`)\n- JavaScript assignment: Title='JS Test Title', Desc='JS Test Description' - both correct\n- fill_form: Title='Chrome Test Title', Desc='Chrome Test Description' - both correct\n\n#### 2. Button Stuck Test\n\n**Result:** INCONCLUSIVE\n- Button correctly showed 'Creating...' during submission\n- Button returned to normal state after API timeout\n- Cannot fully verify due to API issue (see below)\n\n#### 3. Bead Creation Test\n\n**Result:** FAILED - but NOT a form bug\n\n**Error:**\n```\nPOST /api/beads returned 500:\n{\"error\":\"BeadCommandError\",\"message\":\"Command timed out after 10 seconds\"}\n```\n\n**Root Cause:** The bd daemon is slow to start (\u003e5s warning). The API endpoint times out waiting for the daemon.\n\n### New Issues Found\n\n**NEW BUG:** API `/api/beads` endpoint times out when bd daemon is slow\n- CLI works fine (falls back to direct mode)\n- API doesn't handle daemon slowness gracefully\n- Recommend: Increase timeout or implement direct mode fallback in API\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Close this verification bead as PASSED** - the original form input isolation bug IS fixed\n2. **Create new bug** for API timeout issue\n3. **Note for future testing:** Use `fill_form` instead of sequential `fill` for multi-field forms","created_at":"2026-01-29T17:50:14Z"}]}

New Bead Statuses/Flow\n```\nopen → in_progress → ready_for_qa → qa_in_progress → ready_for_review → done\n```\n\nOr use labels:\n- `dev` → `qa` → `review` progression\n\n### 2. Dev Workflow Update\nDev should NOT merge or close. After PR created:\n```bash\nbd update \u003cid\u003e --status=ready_for_qa\n# OR: bd update \u003cid\u003e --labels qa --remove-label dev\n```\n\n### 3. QA Workflow Update\nQA claims beads in `ready_for_qa` status:\n```bash\nbd ready --status=ready_for_qa  # or -l qa\n```\n\nQA checks out the PR branch (not main):\n```bash\ngh pr checkout \u003cpr-number\u003e\n# Run tests on PR branch\n```\n\n### 4. QA Approves PR\nAfter testing passes:\n```bash\ngh pr review \u003cnumber\u003e --approve\nbd update \u003cid\u003e --status=ready_for_review\n```\n\n### 5. Code Reviewer Merges\nReviewer sees approved PRs:\n```bash\ngh pr merge \u003cnumber\u003e --squash\nbd close \u003cid\u003e\n```\n\n### 6. Agent Availability Check\nBefore setting `ready_for_qa`, check if QA is running:\n```bash\nmab status --role qa  # Show if QA agent is active\n# If no QA, warn user or auto-skip QA step\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n- `prompts/DEVELOPER.md` - Don't merge, hand off to QA\n- `prompts/QA.md` - Checkout PR branch, approve PR\n- `prompts/CODE_REVIEWER.md` - Merge after QA approval\n- `prompts/_COMMON.md` - Document status flow\n- `bd` CLI - Add status transitions\n\n## Worktree Impact\nQA worktree needs to checkout dev's PR branch:\n```bash\ncd $WORKER_WORKTREE\ngh pr checkout \u003cnumber\u003e  # Switches to PR branch\n```\nThis works because worktrees can checkout any branch.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T16:15:22.389172-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-02-02T17:35:16.436901-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T17:35:16.436901-06:00","close_reason":"PR #73 merged - implemented dev→QA→reviewer handoff workflow","labels":["dev"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"multi_agent_beads-a6nkq","depends_on_id":"multi_agent_beads-f6in5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-02T16:29:33.216586-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson"}]}

Use WORKER_ID (like 'dev-1') instead of PID for tracking - but log format uses PIDs\n2. Parse WORKER_ID from env and use that in log format  \n3. Track sessions by time proximity rather than PID\n\nFiles:\n- dashboard/routes/agents.py - agent tracking logic\n- mab/spawner.py - log function definition at line 654\n\nCurrent log function: log() { echo \"[$WORKER_ID]\" } - but logs show PIDs, not worker IDs\nSomething is overriding or ignoring WORKER_ID","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T08:56:17.058679-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-02-02T10:53:13.129634-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T10:53:13.129634-06:00","close_reason":"PR #61 merged - fix uses worker_id tracking instead of PIDs"}

Starts the dashboard server (subprocess)\n2. Prints instructions for Claude to execute Chrome MCP commands\n3. Can be run interactively by Claude\n\n### Chrome MCP Commands to Use\n- `navigate_page` to http://127.0.0.1:8000\n- `take_snapshot` to see page state\n- `click` on navigation elements\n- `fill` forms (like agent spawn form)\n- `list_console_messages` to check for errors\n\n### Test Coverage\n1. Spin up dashboard server\n2. Navigate to all pages and verify they load\n3. Click all navigation links\n4. View logs page and verify streaming works\n5. Spin up an agent of each type (Developer, QA, Tech Lead, etc.)\n6. Verify all agents start successfully\n7. Create beads via the UI\n8. Watch agents work on created beads\n9. View completed beads\n10. Report any failures\n\n### Verification Criteria\n- All pages return 200 and render correctly\n- Agent spawn buttons work and create agents\n- Beads can be created via UI\n- Logs stream correctly\n- No console errors","notes":"## Evidence / Current State\n\n### What Exists\n- `tests/e2e/test_chrome_mcp_e2e.py` - Uses HTTP requests (pytest + requests lib), NOT Chrome MCP\n- `tests/e2e/test_interactive_e2e.py` - Also exists\n\n### What's Broken/Missing\nThe existing tests use `requests.get()` to check HTTP 200 responses. This is NOT Chrome MCP testing:\n```python\n# Current approach (NOT Chrome MCP):\nresp = requests.get(f'{self.base_url}{path}', timeout=10)\nif resp.status_code != 200: errors.append(...)\n```\n\n### What's Actually Needed\nReal Chrome MCP testing using Claude's MCP tools:\n- `mcp__chrome-devtools__navigate_page`\n- `mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot`\n- `mcp__chrome-devtools__click`\n- `mcp__chrome-devtools__fill`\n\nThese test real browser interactions, not just HTTP endpoints.\n\n### Why This Matters\nHTTP tests pass but miss:\n- JavaScript rendering issues\n- Click handler bugs\n- Form submission failures\n- CSS/layout problems\n- Console errors","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-01-30T15:49:23.521384-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-01-30T16:01:30.261161-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-30T16:01:30.261161-06:00","close_reason":"PR #19 merged, Chrome MCP test runner implemented and verified working"}

Run from any folder (like beads does)\n2. Support multiple concurrent \"towns\" of workers on different ports\n3. Provide a Web UI admin page for all management (no CLI required for spawning)\n4. Work in conjunction with the beads daemon pattern\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n### 1. Portable Installation\n- Install as a global CLI tool (like `bd` itself)\n- Run `mab init` in any repo to enable agent orchestration\n- No project-specific installation required\n\n### 2. Daemon Architecture  \n- Background daemon process for worker lifecycle management\n- RPC communication (like beads uses)\n- Health monitoring and auto-restart\n- Clean shutdown handling\n\n### 3. Web Admin UI\n- Start/stop workers with a click\n- Choose port per town instance\n- View all active towns and their workers\n- Real-time logs and status per worker\n- Role-based worker spawning (Developer, QA, Tech Lead, etc.)\n\n### 4. Multi-Town Support\n- Run multiple independent orchestrations\n- Each town on its own port\n- Isolated worker pools per town\n- Cross-town visibility in a master dashboard (optional)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Can run `mab` from any folder after global install\n- [ ] Single daemon manages worker lifecycle\n- [ ] Web UI replaces CLI for all worker operations\n- [ ] Can run 3+ towns simultaneously on different ports\n- [ ] Works seamlessly with existing beads integration","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T16:08:31.798517-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-01-26T18:14:38.167452-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T18:14:38.167452-07:00","close_reason":"All success criteria met: (1) CLI tool with global entry point, (2) Daemon with RPC/health checks, (3) Web Admin UI with spawn/stop/monitor, (4) Multi-town support with SQLite persistence, (5) Beads integration via dashboard routes.

--roles manager,tech_lead,dev,qa,reviewer\n```\n- All roles present\n- Full automation\n- Proper handoffs\n- Cost: 5 Claude instances\n\n### Option 2: Core Team (Balanced)\n```bash\nmab town create core --roles dev,qa,reviewer\n```\n- Human acts as Manager (creates beads manually)\n- Human acts as Tech Lead (provides design guidance)\n- Automated: code → test → review → merge\n- Cost: 3 Claude instances\n\n### Option 3: Dev Pair (Minimum Viable)\n```bash\nmab town create minimal --roles dev,qa\n```\n- Human acts as Manager, Tech Lead, Reviewer\n- Automated: code → test\n- Human merges PRs\n- Cost: 2 Claude instances\n\n### Option 4: Solo Dev (Cheapest)\n```bash\nmab worker spawn dev  # or: mab town create solo --roles dev\n```\n- Human does everything except coding\n- Just automated implementation\n- Cost: 1 Claude instance\n\n---\n\n## Town vs Individual Worker\n\n### Require Town? NO - Allow Both\n\n**Individual Worker Use Cases:**\n- Quick one-off task\n- Human wants to be in the loop\n- Testing/debugging\n- Cost-conscious\n\n**Town Use Cases:**\n- Ongoing project work\n- Full automation desired\n- Multiple parallel tasks\n- Team coordination needed\n\n### CLI Design\n```bash\n# Individual worker (no town required)\nmab worker spawn dev --project .\n\n# Create town with specific roles\nmab town create myproject --roles dev,qa --project .\n\n# Start town (spins up all configured roles)\nmab town start myproject\n\n# Quick start with defaults (dev + qa)\nmab start  # Auto-creates town from current directory\n```\n\n---\n\n## Coordination Mechanisms\n\n### 1. Bead Status Flow\n```\nopen → in_progress → ready_for_qa → qa_in_progress → ready_for_review → review_in_progress → done\n```\n\n### 2. Label Routing\n- `-l dev` - Developer work\n- `-l qa` - QA work  \n- `-l review` - Review work\n- `-l design` - Tech Lead work\n- `-l blocked` - Needs human intervention\n\n### 3. Dependency Blocking\n```bash\nbd dep add \u003cbug-id\u003e \u003cfeature-id\u003e  # Feature blocked by bug\n```\n\n### 4. PR-Based Handoff\n- Dev creates PR → triggers QA\n- QA approves PR → triggers Reviewer\n- Reviewer merges → closes bead\n\n---\n\n## Worktree Strategy\n\n### All Workers Get Worktrees\nEach worker (regardless of role) gets isolated worktree:\n```\n.worktrees/\n├── worker-dev-abc123/      # Dev's workspace\n├── worker-qa-def456/       # QA's workspace  \n├── worker-reviewer-ghi789/ # Reviewer's workspace\n```\n\n### Branch Sharing via PRs\n```bash\n# Dev creates PR from their branch\ngit push -u origin worker/worker-dev-abc123\ngh pr create\n\n# QA checks out the PR\ngh pr checkout 42\n\n# Reviewer reviews same PR\ngh pr review 42\n```\n\n### Shared Beads Database\nAll worktrees symlink to main `.beads/`:\n```bash\n.worktrees/worker-dev-abc123/.beads → ../../.beads\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **P0**: Define status flow (ready_for_qa, ready_for_review)\n2. **P0**: Update prompts for proper handoffs\n3. **P1**: Town creation with role selection\n4. **P1**: Auto-start configured roles\n5. **P2**: Dashboard town management\n6. **P2**: Agent availability checks","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mark.johnson@enverus.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T16:19:44.325608-06:00","created_by":"mark.johnson","updated_at":"2026-02-02T17:32:39.692947-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T17:32:39.692947-06:00","close_reason":"Design document created: docs/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md - merged to master","labels":["dev"]}

Check worker stderr (not just claude.log)\n2. Run claude CLI manually with worker prompt to reproduce\n3. Check for missing environment variables\n4.
